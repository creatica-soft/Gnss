gps is a readline-based linux console application to interact with u-blox8 GNSS receivers.
Supports both NMEA and u-blox protocols.
Features extended help and autocomplete actions.
Support practically all features documented by u-blox in protocol versions up to 18.
Provides wire-level debugging options for UBX and NMEA as well as standard protocol debugging options for NMEA and UBX.
Compile with g++ -O -o gps gps.cpp -lreadline

Example usage:
./gps
> open com1 /dev/ttyAMA0 115200
> display all off
> ubxRate pvt 1
> ubxRate tp 1
> ubxRate clock 1
> ubxRate timels 1
> config save
> exit

The above example will configure GNSS receiver to send periodic 
UBX-NAV-PVT UBX-NAV-CLOCK UBX-NAV-TIMELS and UBX-TIM-TP messages every second.
